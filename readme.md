# DAS Beta

The Discord Algebra System (DAS) is a high quality calculator that supports TeX rendering and graphing to enhance the study of mathematics via Discord. 

**NOTE: This is a unfinished prototype and is likely to contain bugs. Version 1 has been released and DAS is now available for public use. Add DAS to your server with the link below.**

## Showcase

## Features
- Graph equations (polynomials, trig functions and conic sections)
- Display math text (or render TeX) as an image
- Solve equations (both real and complex solutions)
- Derive and integrate equations
- Factor and expand expressions
- Basic calculator functions (e.g. add, divide, etc)

## Difference between Beta and V1

- Beta version shipped same graphing algorithm as [Quirky](https://github.com/EmperorOwl/Quirky), which was only able to render equations in the form y=x and struggled to graph trig ones. V1 combines both Sympy and Matplotlib to produce most types of graphs both faster and with greater accuracy.

- Much more features, including definite integrals, graphing reactions and robust error handling.
